                        <h4>Jaclyn Szelong</h4>
						<p>Jaclyn has been practicing different styles of yoga at various studios around Ann Arbor and West Michigan. She has recently completed her 200 RYT training at Seva Yoga with Michele Fife. Jaclyn also holds a Bachelor's of Health Science degree, has studied yoga anatomy under Dr. Ray Long (a renowned orthopedic surgeon and Iyengar Yoga instructor), and attended an Ashtanga Yoga workshop under Manju Pattahbi Jois in Chicago.</p>

<p>Jaclyn describes yoga as "not just a fuel for the body, but food for the soul." She is excited to begin her teaching journey with On The Path Yoga. Drawing influence from nature, Jaclyn explores the range of motion and flow that an enfettered body and soul can experience in a harmonious way. "Yoga has affected my life both on and off the mat. From being more patient, to having a greater awareness of body and mind, I feel the impact of yoga every day of my life." She is excited to pass on these experiences as well as guide others through a personal yoga experience of their own.</p>
